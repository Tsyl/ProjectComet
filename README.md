Action RPG inspired by fighting games' overall flow.

# How to Play
Each player gets a team of 3 characters, and each character gets 4 skills. You use the available skills
to lower the health of another player's characters. When the character's life or stamina reaches 0,
they are knocked out and become unable to fight. Whoever gets the entire opposing party knocked out
first wins the match.
