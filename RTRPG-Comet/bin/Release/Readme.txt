Terminology:
-Life: A character's Life bar. It is persistent from match to match. A character is
downed if it hits 0.
-Stamina: A character's Stamina bar. It refills after each match. A character is
downed if it hits 0.
-Health: The combination of both health and stamina. Damaging skills that affect
this alter stamina first, with any overflowing damage going over to health, while
healing skills affect life first and viceversa.

KNOWN BUGS:
-Currently games are best of one, so Life is meaningless.
-Caltrops and Sabotage are indefinitely stuck to a character. They work as intended
 post-activation.
-There is controller support, though its join game button is currently not working.
